    "* **Algorithms:** While in Python you can just use `sorted()` or `.sort()` to sort the elements of a list, under the hood the sorting has to be handled by some sort of sorting algorithm. Your task here is to implement \"Selection Sort\", a simple sorting algorithm, from scratch. Selection sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that organizes a list by repeatedly finding the smallest element and moving it to its correct position in the sorted section of the list. Selection sort works in five steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. *Initialize the First Position:* Start with the first element of the list as the \"current position\" where the smallest element will eventually be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. *Find the Minimum Element:* Search the rest of the list to locate the smallest element in the unsorted portion. This minimum value is the element that should come next in the sorted order. For that, we iterate over the list & always keep track of the smallest value we found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. *Swap the Elements:* Swap the smallest element found with the element at the \"current position.\" This action places the smallest element in its final sorted location.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. *Move to the Next Position:* Move the \"current position\" one step forward to the next element in the list and repeat the process. Each time, the sorted section of the list grows by one element from the left side.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. *Repeat:* Continue this process until you have iterated through the entire list, ultimately resulting in a fully sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find \"Pseudocode\" for this algorithm for reference:\n",
