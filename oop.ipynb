    "**Object-oriented programming**, or short **OOP**, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs such that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual **objects**. Another common programming paradigm is **procedural programming** which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task. **Objects** are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well. An object can be anything that has some characteristics and functions. Focusing first on the data, each thing or object is an **instance** of some **class**. Also **classes** are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something."

    "Object-oriented programming offers the following **advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If code is written in classes, it can be shared by multiple instances and **reused** multiple times.\n",
    "- The modular structure, in which classes are strictly separated, ensures **clear** and **maintable** code.\n",
    "- Through the logical separation of each object, possible errors can be **traced** back to the actual problem more easily, especially with hightly nested code.\n",
    "- When a user writes his code, then it is more **clear** which object and which data he is working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advantages, object-oriented programming also has a few **drawbacks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the amount of code and the number of classes, also the overall **complexity** of the program increases.\n",
    "- If **real-world** objects and their relations are **unclear**, then it can be very difficult to find an object-oriented structure.\n",
